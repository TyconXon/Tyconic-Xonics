Planned decks:

Tainted eden: randomize jokers every discard. Keeps rarity..?

Tainted bethany: all jokers are perishable, infinite slots

Jacob and esau: TLaz but after every discard/play. Also transfers consumables and vouchers.

Lazarus: you can die once per ante. Lower hands and discards or higher scorebase. If you don't die after an ante, gain a negative joker or banana

Tainted judas: Poker hands snap to the closest large poker hand. ( j q k = straight, c c = flush, etc). Poker hand played is temporarily lowered by how many cards are missing

Lost: 1 discard per round
T lost: 1 discard per run, holy card is a tarot

Samson: The lower the hands you have and the lower score you have, the more x mult you have

T samson: same trigger as before, but it's not immediately activated, it builds up a meter. Completing a blind within a hand builds it up too. Rage lasts for 2 blinds

T eve: discarding a single card builds up mult, less discards

Magnifying glass (vonsumable): see next 5 cards

Judas: -1 consumable slot, get glass card tarot every boss blind

The forgotten: flip hands and discards whenever. When you do, subtract a hand or discard

Lilith: lvl 0 hands, start with joker that builds via poker hand uses

Apolloyon: all sold consumables are stored. Retrievable as negative rentals (sell for -3)

Bethany: eternal book of virtues consumable - turns shop items into $1 dollar whisp versions, whisp cards have a 1/4 chance to be destroyed after each discard

T esau: when you discard, all cards are discarded. Discarded cards are put back in deck

T jacob: if boss blind end score is not 1.5x required score, set next blind to only have 1 hand. Otherwise, gain banana (1/6 chance for cavendish)

Steven: boss blind randomized per discard, if regular blind, randomize score minimum  through a multiplier
